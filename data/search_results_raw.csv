41176447,Improving patient-centered care and efficiency in the fetal MRI Service: A quality improvement initiative.,"Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a vital tool for characterizing abnormalities detected on prenatal ultrasound, but receiving results can be emotionally challenging for patients. Patients typically receive imaging results from the ordering provider, however, in our practice radiologists traditionally conducted immediate face-to-face image review sessions with patients. The aim of this project was to improve patient-centered delivery of image results while optimizing the efficiency of the fetal MRI service workflow by removing direct radiologist review of images and results with patients. After the intervention was implemented, there was a significant reduction in average time radiologists spent per patient exam by 32 % and average report turnaround time by 55 %. Patient surveys indicated that most patients preferred receiving results from their maternal-fetal medicine specialist or obstetrician rather than the radiologist. Eliminating radiologist-patient image review sessions in the fetal MRI service improved efficiency while prioritizing patient-centered care.",2025,Current problems in diagnostic radiology,10.1067/j.cpradiol.2025.10.014,Veena S Peraka; Rebekah Clarke; Jennifer D Smith; Jeannie K Kwon
41175535,Torsion of Undescended Testis in Children Detected By Point-of-Care Ultrasound.,"Torsion of undescended testis (UDT) is a rare urological emergency requiring immediate intervention to salvage the affected testis. Ultrasonography is used for identifying torsion of UDT, but it is mostly performed by radiologists or urologists. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is currently used in pediatric emergency care but reports of its use for diagnosing torsion of UDT are scarce.",2025,The Journal of emergency medicine,10.1016/j.jemermed.2025.08.030,Takaaki Mori; Sung Shin Teng
41171584,Psychomotor skill transfer between non-patient and patient training: a point-of-care ultrasound use case.,"While it's commonplace in medical education to train learners using simulated patient encounters, task trainers, or by practicing skills on healthy volunteers, little is known about how well learning and skills transfer to patient care. The purpose of this research is to quantify Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) skill transfer to patient care through performance assessment. A quantitative analysis of aggregated data consisting of image quality of student-performed POCUS examinations from one midwestern Physician Assistant program was performed. Probabilities for scores of 1-2, 3, 4, and 5 were estimated using a multivariable cumulative logit model. Forty-six PA students were included in the study. A total of 6,218 POCUS examinations were included; 4,506 on non-patients, and 1,712 on patients. When evaluating skill transfer from non-patients to patients, the probability of obtaining a high-quality examination decreases significantly, with a more substantial decrease in performance on more complex skills. The probability of a high-quality examination on the twenty-fifth examination was the highest when learning transfer happened earlier. While training medical providers using non-patient experiences is common, educators must understand the significant loss of quality upon skills transfer to patient care. More complex or higher risk skills likely require close monitoring at the point of skill transfer, to support the learner and ensure patient safety. Based on the findings of this research, earlier skill transfer is associated with worse immediate performance but better long-term re-learning outcomes. Increased deliberate practice prior to skill transfer is associated with better first-time performance on actual patients.",2025,Advances in health sciences education : theory and practice,10.1007/s10459-025-10487-8,Michael Breunig; Andrew Hanson; Ryan Kingsley; Deanne T Kashiwagi

41170796,Placental insufficiency and late-onset growth restriction in fetuses appropriate for gestational age.,"Fetal growth restriction is a condition in which the fetus fails to reach its genetically determined growth potential, most often as a result of impaired placental function. The late-onset form, which develops after 32 weeks of gestation, poses a significant diagnostic challenge due to its subtle clinical and sonographic manifestations. Placental insufficiency is usually associated with pregnancies that meet the established diagnostic criteria for fetal growth restriction. However, there is increasing evidence to suggest that even fetuses with an estimated weight appropriate for gestational age may be affected by a subclinical form of this condition. Typical features of advanced placental dysfunction include abnormal Doppler flow patterns, a slowed fetal growth trajectory, altered levels of maternal serum biomarkers, and specific histopathological findings in the placenta. Despite advances in prenatal diagnostics, there is still no reliable tool capable of identifying pregnancies complicated by placental insufficiency in a timely manner, especially in cases without overt fetal growth deviation. This diagnostic gap limits our ability to identify fetuses at increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes.",2025,Ceska gynekologie,10.48095/cccg2025398,Luděk Kostka; Marta Ježová; Zuzana Mikulenková; Anna Jouzová; Lukáš Hruban
41170354,Fetal Ovarian Cysts in Prenatal Imaging: Diagnostic Challenges and Management Options.,"Fetal ovarian cysts (FOCs) are a rare prenatal finding that may be associated with maternal, fetal, or neonatal complications. They are classified by various features - small or large, simple or complex, unilateral or bilateral - which determine whether active treatment or simple observation is required. Prenatal ultrasound enables diagnosis as early as the first trimester, though most cases are detected in the second or third trimester. We present a case of a simple, small FOC diagnosed at 27 weeks of gestation in primigravida without accompanying diseases. The cyst remained uncomplicated throughout pregnancy and after birth, with spontaneous regression observed within the first year of life. We also conducted a brief literature review on the management of different types of FOCs. Small, asymptomatic FOCs detected in the second or third trimester usually require only ultrasound monitoring, as most regress spontaneously within the first year after birth. Symptomatic neonatal ovarian cysts, as well as those that enlarge during follow-up in pregnancy, carry a risk of ovarian torsion and generally require surgical intervention. Complex cysts and large cysts may be monitored conservatively unless they cause symptoms or show growth on serial ultrasounds.",2025,Journal of medical cases,10.14740/jmc5173,Nikoleta Stoyanova; Angel Yordanov; Nikola Popovski

41167522,In Vitro Model Employing Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) for the Simulation of Radiologic Intraoperative Liver Punctures and Biopsies.,"To develop a training model for contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS)-guided biopsy during the learning phase.An in-vitro model using porcine liver with olive-shaped lesions marked by pepper seeds was employed to simulate tumor biopsies. After targeted injection of sulfur-hexafluoride microbubbles as contrast agent, both native and CEUS-guided biopsies were performed using 18G core needles. Linear transducers of a high-end ultrasound device (3-15 MHz) and of a portable handheld ultrasound device (3-12 MHz) were utilized. Freehand biopsies were conducted both in-plane and out-of-plane. Twelve procedures each were performed by experienced and novice examiners on lesions located at depths of 2-4 cm, with comparisons made regarding procedure duration and image quality. Image and procedure quality were assessed by two independent readers using a scale from 0 (insufficient) to 5 (excellent).CEUS enabled more precise localization and marking of poorly delineated lesions, thereby facilitating targeted biopsy, even in deeper tissue layers. Particularly under challenging acoustic conditions, CEUS improved the planning and execution of interventions for both experienced and novice users when using handheld ultrasound devices. In this in-vitro study, CEUS provided a significant advantage for experienced users working with handheld systems (p < 0.05), whereas its integration into high-end systems did not lead to a significant difference in procedure time (p > 0.05). Novice users, however, benefited significantly from CEUS when using high-end systems (p < 0.01).CEUS-marked lesions in the in-vitro model allow for realistic training of targeted punctures and biopsies - even for lesions not clearly visible in B-mode imaging. Despite the absence of circulation, the contrast effect remains sufficiently stable to practice CEUS techniques under conditions closely resembling clinical practice. This supports the safe application of portable ultrasound systems in interventional procedures. · In-vitro model realistically simulates CEUS-guided liver biopsy procedures. · CEUS enhances delineation of target lesions in inhomogeneous liver parenchyma. · CEUS improves lesion visibility for inexperienced examiners. · Model is suitable for teaching CEUS-guided biopsy techniques. · Brandenstein MK, Becker C, Kupke LS et al.

41166508,A Resident-led Quality Improvement Initiative to Accelerate Medical Therapy Implementation in Acute Heart Failure; ACCELERATE-HF.,"Introduction Guideline-directed medical therapy (GDMT) optimization and effective de-congestion are known to improve outcomes in admitted heart failure (HF) patients, yet their implementation is suboptimal. Using a HF decision aid and point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) at admission, this resident-led quality improvement (QI) initiative aimed to improve GDMT use and reduce HF readmissions. Methods This prospective, single-center QI initiative compared resident-performed POCUS and HF decision-aid use (the QI arm) with routine hospital care in admitted HF patients. Assignment to the QI arm was based on availability of residents trained to perform POCUS on admission. Primary outcome: 30-day hospital readmission; secondary outcomes: GDMT utilization using a standard score, adverse outcome occurrence, and 30-day mortality. Results The study was terminated early due to funding constraints. We enrolled 103 (42 in the QI arm) out of planned 254 patients. At discharge, the QI arm had a trend towards improvement in GDMT scores (+21±23% vs +12±24% in controls, p=0.106), in particular, a numerically higher proportion of patients in the QI arm were discharged on renin-angiotensin-aldosterone blockers (70.4% vs 51.4% of controls, p=.126). Adverse effect occurrence and 30-day outcomes (readmissions and mortality) were not significantly different between groups. Significantly more people in the QI arm had a transthoracic echocardiogram in the hospital (26 (65.0%) vs control: 21 (38.9%), p=.012). Conclusion This study showed that a resident-led QI initiative was feasible and resulted in modest improvement in GDMT use and echocardiography utilization but without effectively altering 30-day outcomes.",2025,Cardiology,10.1159/000549118,Bryce Alexander; Robyn Jackson; Angela Builes; Shahad Sheerah; Taylor Nikel; Arjun Narain Sharma; Laura Scott; Jeffrey Lam; Drew McLean; Sheung Wing Sherwin Wong; Rebecca Wood; Aws Almufleh

However, it can present with symptoms that mimic other conditions, such as spontaneous muscle hematoma, making accurate differentiation essential. We report the case of a 38-year-old man who developed right leg swelling and tenderness seven days after an uncomplicated femoral access coronary angiogram. Clinical suspicion for DVT was supported by elevated D-dimer levels, and enoxaparin therapy was initiated. However, point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) identified a large muscle hematoma. Orthopedic assessment ruled out compartment syndrome, and a formal Doppler ultrasound of the lower limb confirmed the diagnosis. Anticoagulation was discontinued, and a follow-up scan was scheduled to monitor hematoma resolution. This case underscores the critical role of bedside imaging in acute presentations where clinical findings may be misleading. POCUS bridged the gap between clinical suspicion and definitive diagnosis, playing a pivotal role in guiding patient management.",2025,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.93401,Sunil Sharan; Latif Rahman; Md Ariful Islam; Vickie Wong; Md Samiul Islam; Asif Swapnil; Adarsh Bhowon
41162590,Neonatal SONography Assisted Resuscitation (NeoSONAR): Scoping review of the current literature and future directions.,"Ultrasound is increasingly utilized during cardiac arrest in adult populations. The European Society of Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care and the American Academy of Pediatrics have published guidelines on the use of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in neonates and children. However, there were no specific recommendations for its use during the Neonatal Resuscitation Program (NRP) algorithm. In this narrative review, we map the existing evidence to evaluate its role, potential benefits, and limitations of POCUS integration during neonatal resuscitation. The limited available studies, mostly case reports, suggest that POCUS can aid in the early identification of correctable or modifiable causes, evaluation of cardiac function, detection of heart rate or pulseless electrical activity, and guidance of resuscitative efforts. Significant gaps remain in knowledge, research studying its feasibility and benefits, and a lack of specific training and standardized protocols for integrating POCUS into the NRP algorithm, emphasizing the need for further research.",2025,Journal of perinatology : official journal of the California Perinatal Association,10.1038/s41372-025-02458-z,Yogen Singh; Satyan Lakshminrusimha; Belinda Chan

41150089,"Sonographic Assessment of Hyperechoic Vertical Artifact Characteristics in Lung Ultrasound Using Microconvex, Phased Array, and Linear Transducers.","Hyperechoic vertical artifacts are an essential feature of lung ultrasound (LUS) arising from various pathological states. Those that meet the criteria for B-lines have the most significant diagnostic value and should be differentiated from other hyperechoic vertical artifacts of unspecified clinical importance. Although numerous studies have assessed the impacts of transducer type on the appearance of B-lines in human medicine, comparative studies in veterinary medicine are limited and conflicting. This study compares three transducer types for the assessment of hyperechoic vertical artifacts in dogs. We hypothesize that there is high-level reviewer agreement in the assessment of HVA image quality and characteristics, and that the image quality/characteristics differ between the three transducers. Dogs (n = 8) with HVAs and sonographic absence of lung consolidations, pleural effusion, and/or pneumothorax were enrolled. Twenty-four cine-loops (5 s) containing HVAs were retrospectively and independently reviewed by two reviewers, who were blinded to the case details but not transducer type. The reviewers assessed the cine-loops for the following: whether HVAs meet the B-line criteria, ease of counting HVAs, and overall image quality. Paired cine-loops from the same patient using different transducers were then presented for HVA quality comparison. Inter-rater concordance was determined using the Kappa coefficient, Kendall's tau, and Pearson correlation coefficient, while characteristics were compared using chi-square and Kruskal-Wallis tests (level of significance, α = 0.05). The overall concordance of image quality was good (Pearson's coefficient = 0.82).

This study compared PoCUS-first and CT-only strategies, evaluating associations with resource use and clinical outcomes in adult ED patients. This propensity score-weighted cohort study included adults (≥ 18 years) presenting with non-traumatic abdominal pain to the ED of a tertiary medical center in Taiwan between January 2021 and December 2023. Patients transferred or discharged against medical advice from other facilities were excluded. Encounters were classified as PoCUS-first (PoCUS alone and followed by CT) or CT-only. Primary outcomes were ED LOS and costs; secondary outcomes were unscheduled return visit (URV), hospital LOS, total costs, ICU admission, and in-hospital mortality. Multivariate regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) adjusted for baseline differences. Among 26,403 index ED visits, 67.5% received PoCUS‑first evaluation and 32.5% underwent CT only. After adjustment, PoCUS‑first was associated with substantially shorter ED LOS (ratio of means 0.53, 95% CI 0.52-0.54; 47% reduction), lower ED costs (0.52, 95% CI 0.51-0.53; 48% reduction), fewer consultations, and reduced admission rates. In patients discharged at the index visit (n = 17,390), PoCUS‑first was similarly linked to shorter LOS (0.61, 95% CI 0.60-0.62; 39% reduction), markedly lower costs (0.47, 95% CI 0.46-0.47; 53% reduction), and decreased odds of unscheduled return visits (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.69-0.96), without an increase in adverse outcomes. For patients later admitted after a return visit, PoCUS‑first encounters were characterized by lower resource use during the index ED visit, with no evidence of prolonged subsequent care or safety concerns. A PoCUS‑first strategy, used for initial risk stratification, was associated with greater ED efficiency and more judicious resource use without compromising safety. However, the observed reduction in ED LOS may partly reflect local workflow and in‑house processes, and residual confounding cannot be excluded. Confirmation in prospective, multicenter studies is warranted.",2025,Internal and emergency medicine,10.1007/s11739-025-04164-2,Te-Fa Chiu; Tse-Chyuan Wong; Fen-Wei Huang; Eric H Chou; Jon Wolfshohl; Kuan-Fu Chen; Wei-Jun Lin; Shih-Hao Wu

41142972,Gastric dilatation and volvulus in a 5-year-old intact female Holland lop rabbit.,"A 5-year-old intact female Holland lop rabbit was presented with acute hyporexia, lethargy, and marked abdominal pain. Blood biochemistry analysis indicated elevations in ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin. A point-of-care ultrasound revealed displacement of the spleen into the left cranial abdomen, suggestive of gastric dilatation and volvulus (GDV). Exploratory laparotomy confirmed a 180° clockwise GDV. Gastric derotation and incisional gastropexy were successfully completed. The rabbit recovered uneventfully; biochemical values had normalized by Day 5. This is the third documented case of GDV in a rabbit in the peer-reviewed literature and the first involving a Holland lop. Key clinical message: Gastric dilatation and volvulus, though rare in rabbits, should be considered in cases presenting with acute hyporexia, abdominal pain, elevated ALT, variably elevated ALP, and variable hyperbilirubinemia. Ultrasonographic evidence of splenic displacement into the cranial left abdomen strongly supports a tentative diagnosis and indicates the need for immediate surgical exploration or abdominal computed tomography, if available.",2025,The Canadian veterinary journal = La revue veterinaire canadienne,,Logan Kopp
41142004,Case Report: Fetal cardiac rhabdomyoma caused by TSC1 mutation.,"Fetal rhabdomyoma is a rare benign cardiac tumor that primarily occurs during the fetal or neonatal period and is often associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). It is most commonly found in the heart (particularly in the ventricles or interventricular septum) but can also occur in other locations such as the head and neck. It may be accompanied by arrhythmias (e.g., supraventricular tachycardia), pericardial effusion, or fetal hydrops. Larger tumors can lead to blood flow obstruction, heart failure, or sudden death. In this case, prenatal ultrasound at 22 weeks of gestation suggested a ""possible fetal left ventricular rhabdomyoma"" in the proband. The parents were advised to undergo prenatal diagnosis but declined and opted for induced labor. Whole-exome sequencing (familybased) revealed a heterozygous TSC1 mutation in the proband, while both parents exhibited wildtype genotypes. This case report presents an instance of fetal cardiac rhabdomyoma induced by a heterozygous TSC1 mutation, providing valuable insights for the early diagnosis and management of intrauterine fetal cardiac developmental abnormalities.",2025,Frontiers in pediatrics,10.3389/fped.2025.1681439,Xueqin Feng; Qinnggui Ren; Haihong Li; Xinying Liu; Lijuan Li

41141016,Transfusion-Related Acute Lung Injury Detected by Perioperative Lung Ultrasound: Early Recognition With Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS).,"Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) is a rare but potentially life-threatening transfusion reaction characterized by acute hypoxemia and non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema within six hours of transfusion. We report the case of a 20-year-old female patient who developed acute hypoxemia approximately 1.5 hours after receiving one unit of packed red blood cells (PRBCs) during dilation and suction curettage under general anesthesia. Postoperatively, she experienced dyspnea, oxygen desaturation, and coarse bilateral breath sounds. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) demonstrated multiple bilateral B-lines without evidence of pneumothorax, effusion, or cardiac dysfunction, raising suspicion for non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Computed tomography (CT) further revealed bilateral ground-glass opacities and septal thickening, supporting the diagnosis of TRALI. The patient required supplemental oxygen and demonstrated rapid clinical improvement. This case highlights the clinical utility of lung POCUS as an early diagnostic adjunct for differentiating TRALI from other causes of acute postoperative respiratory decompensation.",2025,Cureus,10.7759/cureus.93208,Aaron M Kessler; Arpan Kohli; Grant Neely

41137348,Impact of abnormal amniotic fluid index on maternal and perinatal outcomes in term pregnancies.,"Amniotic fluid, the protective medium within the amniotic sac, plays a vital role in fetal development and maternal well-being during pregnancy. Abnormal amniotic fluid index (AFI), including oligohydramnios (AFI ≤ 2 cm) and polyhydramnios (AFI ≥ 8 cm), is associated with various maternal and fetal complications such as preeclampsia (6.6%), antepartum hemorrhage (3.1%), gestational diabetes (3.5%), prematurity, and intrauterine growth restriction. The objective of this study was to evaluate fetomaternal outcomes in full-term pregnancies with abnormal AFI, with the aim of informing delivery timing and improving both maternal and neonatal outcomes. Furthermore, the study explores the utility of ultrasonography and Doppler imaging in identifying and managing high-risk cases. A prospective observational study was conducted on 60 term pregnancies meeting the inclusion criteria after obtaining informed consent. The incidence of oligohydramnios was 5.33%, and polyhydramnios was 2%. Most cases were observed in women aged 20 to 24 years, with a higher prevalence among primigravida. Oligohydramnios was frequently associated with postdated pregnancy, whereas polyhydramnios was predominantly linked to maternal diabetes. Both conditions were significantly associated with increased rates of cesarean delivery, fetal distress, and neonatal intensive care unit admissions. The findings emphasize the clinical significance of regular AFI monitoring, particularly beyond 37 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonography, coupled with Doppler studies, proved valuable in early detection and informed decision-making, ultimately contributing to better perinatal outcomes. Early identification and timely intervention in pregnancies complicated by abnormal AFI can reduce adverse fetomaternal outcomes and guide clinicians in optimizing delivery management strategies.",2025,Medicine,10.1097/MD.0000000000045320,Dinesh Kumar Meet; Birendra Kumar Yadav; Sajjad Ahmed Khan; Bibisa Bhandari; Tarun Pradhan; Prajwol Thapa; Sanjay Karki; Anisha Uprety

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic value of a novel sonographic marker, the ""Y sign,"" defined as the confluence of the aortic and ductal arches on the sagittal view, in predicting postnatal CoA. In addition, we evaluated the reproducibility and detectability of the ""Y sign"" in a large cohort of structurally normal fetuses.",2025,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,10.1186/s12884-025-08376-4,Halil Korkut Daglar; Didem Kaymak
41136271,Deep Learning Approaches for Thrombosis Detection and Risk Assessment Via Ultrasound Imaging: A Scoping Review.,"Thrombosis, the formation of blood clots within blood vessels, poses serious health risks including pulmonary embolism and post-thrombotic syndrome. Ultrasound (US) imaging is a widely used, non-invasive diagnostic tool owing to its real-time capability and safety profile; however, its effectiveness is often limited by operator dependency and variability in interpretation. This scoping review investigates how deep learning (DL) techniques have been applied to enhance thrombosis detection and risk assessment using US imaging across venous, arterial, and cardiac contexts. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed and Scopus following PRISMA-ScR methodology, targeting studies that used DL models for thrombus detection, classification, segmentation, or risk prediction in conjunction with vascular US modalities such as B-mode, Doppler, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), and transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Out of 233 records initially identified, 22 studies met the eligibility criteria. The most frequently used models included convolutional neural networks (CNNs), U-Net, Residual Neural Networks (ResNet), and Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). DL models mainly aided deep vein thrombosis (DVT) diagnosis by evaluating vein compressibility and supporting point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) imaging. Arterial thrombosis applications focused on plaque segmentation and vessel reconstruction using IVUS, while cardiac studies employed TEE to differentiate thrombi from tumours. Studies often reported high sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC), frequently outperforming traditional rule-based or manual interpretation methods, although considerable variability in datasets and validation approaches was observed. Overall, DL-enhanced US imaging shows great promise for improving diagnostic precision and clinical decision-making in thrombosis care. Future research should prioritize model interpretability, real-world integration, and the development of standardized, publicly accessible datasets.",2025,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,10.1016/j.ultrasmedbio.2025.09.019,Maria Didaskalou; George Ioannakis; Eleni Kaldoudi; George Drosatos

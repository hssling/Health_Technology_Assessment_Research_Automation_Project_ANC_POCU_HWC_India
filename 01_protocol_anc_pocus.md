# HTA Protocol: Point-of-Care Ultrasound (PoCUS) and Basic Diagnostics for Early ANC Risk Detection at Health & Wellness Centres (HWCs) in India

## 1. Background
India continues to face preventable maternal and perinatal deaths arising from late detection of high-risk pregnancies (HRP) — including placenta previa, multiple pregnancy, malpresentation, fetal growth restriction, and oligohydramnios. Under Ayushman Bharat – Health & Wellness Centres (AB-HWC) and comprehensive PHC, there is a policy interest in decentralizing selected ANC diagnostics to the periphery. One such technology is portable/handheld point-of-care ultrasound (PoCUS) plus a basic diagnostic package (Hb, urine, BP, FHR) with tele-radiology backup. This HTA will compare PoCUS-at-HWC with the current referral-based USG model.

## 2. Objectives
**Primary objective:** To estimate the cost-effectiveness of introducing PoCUS + basic ANC diagnostics at HWCs compared to current practice (facility-level USG only).

**Secondary objectives:**
- Budget impact of providing PoCUS to all / selected HWCs.
- Effect of task-sharing (ANM/CHO-operated PoCUS) vs doctor-performed PoCUS.
- Contextual analysis for tribal / hard-to-reach districts.

## 3. PICO
- **Population:** Pregnant women taking ANC in public facilities (HWC/PHC/SC) in India.
- **Intervention:** PoCUS at HWC + basic ANC diagnostics + tele-report.
- **Comparator:** Current ANC with referral to higher facility for USG.
- **Outcomes:** HRP detected, maternal/perinatal adverse outcomes averted, DALYs averted.
- **Perspective:** Government health system.
- **Time horizon:** Pregnancy to 42 days postpartum (base case); 1 year (sensitivity).
- **Discounting:** 3%.

## 4. Methods
- Decision-tree comparing current vs PoCUS.
- Costs: device, O&M, training, scan, referral, management.
- Effectiveness: improvement in detection → reduction in adverse outcomes.
- Sensitivity: device price, scan volume, referral completion, diagnostic accuracy.
